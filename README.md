*"Your words. Your chaos. Your problem."*

An LLM-powered web game where three words you choose generate a unique creature, weapon, and world to fight through — across four completely different game styles.

---

## What It Is

Enter three words (a creature, a weapon, and a weather/force) and watch an LLM turn them into a playable game. Every run is different. The stick figure platformer gives way to a 3D arena, a neon space shooter, and a peaceful isometric farm — all built from the same three words.

All content (creature visuals, stats, weapon behaviors, environment effects) is generated by `llama-3.1-8b-instant` via Groq and rendered entirely in code — no image files, no sprite sheets.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your browser
2. Enter three words: a **creature**, a **weapon**, and a **weather or force of nature**
3. Wait for generation (~1 second, or instant if cached)
4. Fight through all four levels
5. Submit your initials to the leaderboard

## The Four Levels

| Level | Style | Objective |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **1 — 2D Platformer** | Side-scrolling Canvas 2D | Defeat the creature and reach the flagpole |
| **2 — 3D Arena** | Three.js + OrbitControls | Survive and defeat the creature in 3D space |
| **3 — Space Shooter** | Neon vector wireframe | Survive 90 seconds, kill as many enemies as possible |
| **4 — Isometric Farm** | Voxel isometric grid | Milk fantasy cows and deliver bottles before time runs out |

### Controls (all levels)

| Key | L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 |
|-----|----|----|----|-----|
| WASD / Arrows | Move | Move (cam-relative) | Move ship | Move (isometric) |
| Space | Jump | Jump | Fire | — |
| Z | Attack | Attack | Fire | Milk cow (hold) |
| X | Use item | Use item | Bomb | — |
| Q / E | — | Rotate camera | — | — |
| R | Reset | Reset | — | — |

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Game | HTML5 Canvas + vanilla JS | Rendering and game logic |
| 3D (L2) | Three.js | Arena scene, OrbitControls |
| Styling | CSS | Menus, HUD, responsive layout |
| Audio | Web Audio API | Retro sound effects (no audio files) |
| API | Vercel Serverless (Node.js) | LLM proxy, rate limiting, caching |
| Cache / DB | Vercel KV (Upstash Redis) | Generation cache + leaderboard |
| LLM | Groq — `llama-3.1-8b-instant` | Content generation |
| Hosting | Vercel | Auto-deploy on push to `main` |

---

## Asset Viewer

All previously generated creatures, weapons, and environments are stored in localStorage and browsable from the main menu via the **ASSETS** button. Each asset is shown in four rendering styles side by side: **2D** (canvas), **3D** (Three.js), **VECTOR** (neon wireframe, Level 3 style), and **VOXEL** (isometric, Level 4 style). A REGENERATE button re-calls the LLM to get fresh art for any asset.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Vercel CLI (`npm i -g vercel`)
- A [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com)
- A Vercel project with KV storage provisioned

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Randroids-Dojo/Determined.git
cd Determined
npm install
vercel env pull .env.local   # pulls env vars from your linked Vercel project
vercel dev                   # starts local dev server with API routes
```

The game runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### Without Vercel CLI

The frontend is static HTML/CSS/JS. You can open `index.html` directly in a browser but API routes (`/api/generate`, `/api/leaderboard`) will not work without a server environment. Use `vercel dev` for full local functionality.

---

## Deployment

Push to `main` — Vercel auto-deploys.

```bash
git push origin main
```

### Required Environment Variables

Set these in the Vercel dashboard (or `.env.local` for local dev):

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | API key from [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) |
| `KV_REST_API_URL` | Vercel KV connection URL |
| `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` | Vercel KV auth token |

---

## Rate Limits

- **Per IP:** 10 generations per hour
- **Global:** 50 generations per hour
- Cached results (previously generated words) are instant and do not count against limits
